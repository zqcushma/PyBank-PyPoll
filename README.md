# PyBank-PyPoll
Module 3 assignment which includes programs named PyBank and PyPoll

Created by Zachary Cushman for the 2023/2024 Data Analytics bootcamp. Code and errors are my own, however data is provided by instructors.

Background: It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.
